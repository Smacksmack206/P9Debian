**Problem:** Google introduced a basic Debian terminal for developers via AVF in Android 16 Beta 3. While promising, it's heavily restricted, lacks documentation, suffers from severe storage limitations, and misses essential features for practical use.

**Solution:** Project Terminus overcomes these limitations through deep system analysis, reverse engineering, and advanced Linux techniques, providing a truly usable Linux environment on your Android device.
