# Setup QEMU, binfmt, Docker, and QEMU Web Desktop on Debian (aarch64)
# ==================================================================================
#
# This script automates the following tasks:
#   1. Installs QEMU user-mode emulation and registers it with binfmt_misc
#      to allow transparent execution of x86_64 binaries on an ARM64 host.
#   2. Installs Docker Engine, the containerization platform.
#   3. Configures Docker permissions so the current user can run it without 'sudo'.
#   4. Deploys 'qemu-web-desktop', a Docker container that provides a full Linux
#      desktop environment (running under QEMU) accessible via a web browser.
#
# How to run:
#   1. Save this script as 'setup_full_qemu.sh'.
#   2. Make it executable: chmod +x setup_full_qemu.sh
#   3. Run it with sudo:   sudo ./setup_full_qemu.sh
#
